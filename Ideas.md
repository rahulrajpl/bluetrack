# Monitoring and Detecting anomalous security personnel activity through Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) based Pedestrian Deck Reckoning

## Brief Description

A security department by a government or private party is an essential component to protect the employing partyâ€™s assets from a variety of hazards by enforcing preventative measures or prevailing law. It is equally important to ensure the efficacy of the law enforcement entity itself, primarily the personnel deployed on surveillance duties. Common practice is to depend on additional high value assets such as surveillance cameras and variety of other sensors all around the perimeter to monitor security personnel to assess the efficacy of discharging his duty.

In this project, we present a novel way to monitor the security personnel through Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) based Pedestrian Deck Reckoning. We use a wearable IoT device to track the personnel movement without GPS but within a wifi network coverage area. PDR data of each personnel/ or area of deployment is collected to generate a time series data of 'normal' surveillance. This data is then further used is variety of ways to detect whether the surveillance carried by personnel is 'normal' or 'anomaly'. An intuitive and automated web application is created for displaying this 'normal' activity track of each personnel and an alert is generated whenever there is an anomaly detected.
