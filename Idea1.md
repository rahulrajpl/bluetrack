# Automated report generation and debriefing of the Fire fighting/ Damage control mock drills onboard Ships

Fire and Flood are the two hidden enemies of every seagoing vessels and the Indian Naval Ships are no exception. To tackle them, a robust fire fighting and damage control organization exists onboard our Ships. It consist of specific number of personnel (depending on the size of the Ship), divided into different teams with specific responsibilities both as team and as individuals. Mock drills are carried out many times on daily basis to ensure everyone in this organization is well versed with the actions to be taken in case of an actual fire or a flood. After every mock drill, there will be a debriefing session to point out the mistakes by personnel. Many a times, security officer or the drill-in-charge is unaware the actual actions performed by the personnel and thus does not add any value while debriefing since he is oblivious to many mistakes.

In this project, we aim to improve the efficiency of the mock drills as well as to enable more informed debriefing by using pedestrian deck reckoning methods. We will track the entire drill using PDR of each personnel and generate an 'activity map' of the drill carried out. This will be matched with a predefined activity map of a 'perfect mock drill' to find the anomaly and generate a report. This report contains the variations from the rules, mistakes by personnel, recommendations for improvement, etc. Thus, the efficacy of the entire firefighting organization onboard can be improved.
